export const text1 = `Thanks for visiting my site! I am a solo musician based in sunny
Jacksonville, FL. I provide 100% live-looped instrumental jams!
The music I play is mostly improvised and the sounds can range
from funky to wonky, relaxing yet wavey, bluesy to twangy, to
all around trippy and spacey. Its basically chill elevator music
with a tropical space vibe. I have spent the last 15 years
perfecting the art of making people melt on the couch. Thanks
for visiting my site!`;

export const text2 = ` I provide an entertaining and musically engaging show. At the same time, my show is more ambiant than a traditional concert. I just want to play songs and jam out at a comfortable audio level so you and your friends can still have conversations with
one another without yelling over the music! So kick back, and hang out with Jam in the Jam Lounge!`;
