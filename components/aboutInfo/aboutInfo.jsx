          beat, melody, and rhythm you hear is crafted in real time, with no
          backing tracks or any pre-recorded music. I use a bunch of loop machines and effects pedals to put it all together. I play guitar, bass, keyboard, and I put together random jams on the fly with some singing in between!"`}

          through dynamic and spontaneous jams in the Jam Lounge. Truely, every jam I make is an improvised arrangement of sound, rhythm, and melody, brought to life before your ears.
